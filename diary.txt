Current objective: 
- complete US5 - As a user, I want to be able to check off a habit Iâ€™ve completed on the current date. 
- make the habits uncheck themselves when a new day begins (2 cases)


Long term plan
- finish doing frontend and backend
- learn html/css properly
- style my app

Other
- implement method security (more encryption involved from api calls)
- make user unable to add habits that already exists (changes to backend)
- make things like "successfully removed" indicator only show for a few seconds then disappear 
- allow anything except empty for add/remove habit field validation
