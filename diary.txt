Current objective: 
- clean up account details
	- name
	- email

Long term plan
- finish doing frontend and backend
- learn html/css properly
- style my app

Other
- implement method security (more encryption involved from api calls) + validate the user id in the backend ihabit_system methods
- make user unable to add habits that already exists (changes to backend)
- make things like "successfully removed" indicator only show for a few seconds then disappear 
- allow anything except empty for add/remove habit field validation
- fix update habit delay/bug
- fix up logic in routes.py/update habit status - i dont think i need function change todays staus in iHabit system
- clean up routes - make sure logic that belong in habit system is taken there vice versa
